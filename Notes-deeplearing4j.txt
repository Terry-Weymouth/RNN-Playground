Notes on https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples.git

Problems with examples ---
* org.datavec.api.util.ClassPathResource - depricated
  use org.nd4j.linalg.io.ClassPathResource instead
  -- fairly widespread.
  See https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/issues/1764

* org.deeplearning4j.eval.Evaluation - deprecated 
  Use ND4J Evaluation class, which has the same interface: 
  org.nd4j.evaluation.classification.Evaluation.Metric
  See line 29 - https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/...
  deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/eval/Evaluation.java
  Also, very widespread
